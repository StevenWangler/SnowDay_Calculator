Several factors are considered when making the decision to close or delay the school day. Please keep in mind that the Rockford Public School District covers approximately 97 square miles, 
so the weather and road conditions can be significantly different from one area to the next. On any given day, we transport 5,000 to 6,000 of our 8,000 students. We do our best to make reasonable 
and practical decisions based on forecasts, which are sometimes accurate and sometimes not. Here are a few of the steps used determine whether to close or delay school:
We monitor wind chill, wind speed, temperature and precipitation amounts.
We close school when the wind chill is a sustained -20F or colder.
We consult with the county road commission on the road conditions and plowing schedules.
District officials monitor weather reports and talk to neighboring districts.
Finally, district officials and staff physically drive out to several areas multiple times throughout the evening, night and morning to check road conditions.
